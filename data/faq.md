## “I haven’t received my fanzine yet, when is it going to arrive?”

If you subscribe any time this month (between the first and the last day), you will always receive the next month's fanzine. This is because we work on the editions a month prior to the release. For example, we worked on the May issue throughout the whole month of April.

As for printing and packing, we finalise all orders as the clock hits midnight (London, UK time) on the first day of the new month. This is our cutoff time, so if you subscribe after midnight, you will automatically receive next month's issue. It takes about a week or so for the fanzines to be printed by our provider. Once we've received the fanzines from our provider (**usually around the 7th**), we immediately pack and ship them off to you!

Whilst the postal service aims to deliver within a week worldwide, there can be delays for certain parts of the world, especially due to the pandemic or during holiday periods. If you’d like to track your parcel and be certain of its timely arrival, please opt for tracked shipping.

If you're interested in purchasing this month's fanzine (or previous editions), check our shop after the 15th of the month! Sometimes we have a printing mishap and are left with a few extra copies. We always release a digital version of the fanzine on the 15th as well.

## “I might need to cancel my subscription at some point, how can I do this?”

You can cancel your subscription at any time via our shop or directly with your bank. Alternatively, you can email us with your name and first line of the address that you’ve given us.

## “I’m interested in joining The Crossing Board team, where do I apply?”

We sometimes have slots open for new team members, and when we do, we usually announce it on social media. You can check the ‘Join the team’ tab as well to see which positions are open. Please check if it is the right role for you!

## “I sent you an email but I have not received a response!”

Our apologies in advance if we have not replied to your email yet. We try our best to respond as soon as possible but please bear in mind that we are a small team and we get lots of messages every day. If it is an urgent matter, please send us a direct message on Instagram or Twitter.

## “I did not receive my fanzine, what should I do?”

We’re sorry you did not get your fanzine. Unfortunately postal mishaps happen and the parcel can get lost in transit. Firstly we’d like to make sure that the fanzine indeed got lost and not delayed or quarantined at a port or postal office. In some cases, it can take up to a month before your fanzine arrives. If you opted for tracked shipping (which we highly recommend), you can visit your account on our website for the code and see where it was last. If you are sure that your fanzine is lost, please email us about this issue so we can see which solution is best for you.

## “Why should I subscribe if you have digital or extra copies for sale?”

Subscribing means you can be amongst the first group of people that get our monthly fanzines. You may choose a digital copy if you prefer reading on your tablet or any other device, or for sustainability reasons. As for extra physical copies, the number of extra copies we have vary from month to month. To always receive a fanzine, subscribing to our service is the best option!
