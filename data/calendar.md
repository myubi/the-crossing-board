The Crossing Board team are proud to announce our latest venture: A 2021 calendar!

Our fan-made wall calendar is the perfect place to organise your real life and your virtual island getaway. With important dates such as villager birthdays, special events, and seasonal weather - you’ll never miss out on the fun. Stay informed about cherry blossom season, fishing tourneys, bug offs, monthly critters, and much more… much more!

Each month features art by incredible creatives from the community, so keep your eyes peeled for some friendly faces. Filled to the brim with your favorite characters, this organizer is sure to brighten any room. The dimensions of the calendar are A4 (21x30cm or 8.27x11.69 inches).

Preorder your fan-made calendar before the 10th of December to get it in time for the next bulk shipment!
