- The magazine contains around 20 pages of all sorts of content based on Animal Crossing, from articles to activities. A small gift is included. 
- The base price of the magazine is Â£2.99 but shipping varies depending on your country. Please select the correct tier for your country.
- You can cancel your membership anytime. You will receive your magazine for the months you payed.
- Payment is taken immediately from your account and you will be charged again in a month from the day you subscribe.
- As we are just starting out, we've decided to skip the August issue so we can take time to respond to feedback and ensure that our product maintains a high standard. Our next magazine will be open for subscriptions in August and sent out in September, then issues will continue monthly thereafter. If you currently have a subscription, don't fret! You will be charged in August from the date you started for the September issue!
- Please note that magazines go to print on the 5th of every month, commencing in September. If you begin your subscription on or after the 5th (London, UK timezone) you will receive next month's issue.
