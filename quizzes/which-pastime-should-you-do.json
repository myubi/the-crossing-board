    "Stargazing": "You appreciate the simple things in life and love taking time for yourself. Nature fascinates you and you love admiring it. Something you might enjoy is stargazing on a clear night. Take a blanket, lay down, and admire the night sky. Find constellations, planets, and you may even see a shooting star! Celeste would be proud.",
    "Reading a book in nature": "You’re probably someone who already loves to read, but how often do you do it outside? Take a page from your villagers’ book and find a nice tree to plop down next to and read! Anywhere in nature that sounds peaceful is great! Maybe there’s a field close by, or a river down the street. Wherever it is, the peaceful surroundings and noises in nature can help immerse you into your book in ways you’ve never experienced before!",
    "Aerobics": "You’re very energetic, or maybe you just admire those who are. A great way to spend your pastime without even leaving the house is aerobics! It’s a great way to take your mind off things and listen to your favorite music! The best part is, you can go at your own pace and soon you’ll start looking like a pro like your villagers do in front of Resident Services.",
    "Plant Parent": "You have a great admiration for nature and all that comes with it. Not only are you easy going and patient, but you’re also very easy to get along with. One of your favorite parts of decorating your island are the trees and all of the variations of flowers! Why not bring this into real life? You can start off easy by getting a plant that needs minimal care. Or, if you’re already a plant pro, why not grow your collection and show it off!",
