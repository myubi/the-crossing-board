Why not create an area dedicated to one of the most important parts of the game- fishing! Create a lake or pond of any size and make a nice area to hangout and fish. Add some chairs or stools, wooden buckets, fishing rods, street lamps, whatever you fancy. Maybe CJ will even spawn here!",
    "Crafting Nook": "You have most of the DIYs, if not all of them. Crafting and customization is something you probably do often, it can be exhausting! Your island may be filled at every corner with your creations. Why not create a little area dedicated to just that! You can easily design a crafting nook that fits your theme with the right fencing and customization. Use this as a place to store extra tools and materials to leave more room in your pockets for your creations!",
    "Pizzeria": "Your island may be one without a specific theme. You may have many different ideas and put them all together. An area that can go on any island, no matter the theme, is a pizzeria! With the amount of tables and chairs to choose from you’re able to easily customize your pizzeria to your liking!",
    "Outdoor Market": "You may be someone who can’t stand to give away anything in your storage “just in case.” Something you can easily use your extra furniture for is an outdoor market! Craft some stalls and customize them to your liking. Place your items on them and add some stools so you can rest while shopping.",
    "Beachside Restaurant": "You probably love interacting with your villagers, NPC’s, and watching them interact with each other. You may also enjoy having visitors on your island and just relaxing! A great way to bring everyone together is a beachside restaurant! Decorate it according to your theme, or just go crazy with it! Make this a place everyone will want to come back to and bring their friends."
