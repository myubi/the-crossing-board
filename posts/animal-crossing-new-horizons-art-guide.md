A returning character to the Animal Crossing series, the rebranded “Jolly Redd” was added to New Horizons in the 1.2.0 Earth Day update in April 2020. This shady fox will appear on your island every so often at your secret beach on the north shore, selling black market artwork and items on his Treasure Trawler. The paintings and sculptures that feature in the game are in fact based on real-life works of art that you may recognise!

Your first meeting with Redd actually takes place when you see him wandering around the island, once you have donated 60 items to the museum. Interact with him and he will offer to sell you a painting that is always real and donate this to Blathers in order to enable work to begin on a new art exhibit. A short description will always accompany each piece. The Treasure Trawler will then always have four paintings or sculptures in addition to two furniture items. However, because this is Redd we are talking about, there will be fakes so make sure to look closely at each piece to avoid getting caught out!

Luckily, the following pieces of artwork are available that will always be the real thing:

* **Calm Painting**
* **Common Painting**
* **Dynamic Painting**

* **Flowery Painting**
* **Glowing Painting**
* **Moody Painting**
* **Mysterious Painting**
* **Nice Painting**
* **Perfect Painting**
* **Proper Painting**
* **Sinking Painting**
* **Twinkling Painting**
* **Warm Painting**
* **Worthy Painting**
* **Familiar Statue**
* **Great Statue**

Now let’s explore how you can figure out the difference between the genuine works of art and the forgeries.

* **Academic Painting** - The fake version will have a coffee stain in the top right as well as a key taped to the back.
* **Amazing Painting** - You’ll notice the man with the red sash not wearing a hat in the fake painting.
* **Basic Painting** - In the fake painting the boy’s bangs cover his entire forehead, in comparison to the real version, in which there is less hair covering his forehead.
* **Detailed Painting** - The flowers are purple in the forgery, but the real painting has blue flowers.
* **Famous Painting** - The woman’s eyebrows are raised in the fake painting, while she has none (or they’re very faint) in the real painting.
* **Graceful Painting** - The fake sees the woman taking up the entire canvas, but she only takes 2/3 of it in the real version. Another thing to look out for the woman looking to the left in the fake version with a shadowy figure on her back.
* **Jolly Painting** - The forgery is missing an artichoke bud sticking out from the chest.
* **Moving Painting** - You’ll see no trees in the fake painting however, the genuine version does feature trees
* **Quaint Painting** - The fake version has a container in which lots of milk is pouring from
* **Scary Painting** - Look at the eyebrows in this one. They point up in the middle in the fake painting, while they point down in the middle in the real version.
* **Scenic Painting** - There is only one person standing on the hill in the fake painting, but the real one has three people and dogs standing on the hill.
* **Serene Painting** - What the woman is holding is important in this one. It’s a grey ferret in the fake painting, while it’s a white ermine in the real one.
* **Solemn Painting** - The man in the back of this painting is pointing upwards, but in the real one, he’s touching the wall.
* **Wild Painting** (Left Half) - There is a dark figure in the fake version, whereas there is a light figure in the genuine piece.
* **Wild Painting** (Right Half) - It’s the other way round in this one. There is a light figure in the forgery while the real one features a dark figure.
* **Wistful Painting** - The woman’s earring is star-shaped in the fake painting, while it is sphere-shaped in the real version.

* **Ancient Statue** - The fake has antennae, while the real one doesn’t. Also, look out for the eyes glowing blue and the statue floating when interacted with.
* **Beautiful Statue** - The fake version will have lots of necklaces in comparison to the real statue.
* **Gallant Statue** - The fake statue is holding a book in its right hand. There is no book held by the real version.
* **Informative Statue** - The fake is blue in colour, while the real one is grey. You may also notice the fake one glowing.
