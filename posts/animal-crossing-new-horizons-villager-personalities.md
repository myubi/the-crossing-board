title: 'Animal Crossing: New Horizons Villager Personalities'

---
Each of the loveable villagers that live on our islands have their very own personality, just like each of us! These personalities influence a lot in Animal Crossing New Horizons including how the villager talks, what they wear, and even how they interact with other villagers. But what are these personalities?!

In total there are 8 different personalities and these are split between female and male villagers.

### Male Personality Types

**Cranky**

Cranky villagers spend most of their day wondering around the island and gossiping with other villagers. Most of them will wear jackets, t-shirts or sweaters. They get along well with Snooty villagers and also enjoy spending time with Jock, Normal and Lazy personalities. They don't get on very well with Peppy, Smug or Sisterly villagers.

**Jock**

Jock villagers love sports and fitness! They can often be found expressing their dedication to their physique to other villagers. They love to spend their time outdoors and will usually be exercising around the island. As they are always ready to go, they will often be found wearing tank tops or t-shirts.

Jock villagers get along well with all personality types apart from Snooty and Lazy villagers as they don't understand their more relaxed lifestyles!

**Lazy**

Lazy villagers love to spend the majority of their day in their house, usually with a snack! They love eating, and love to talk about food with their friends. When they do venture outside, they love to go fishing, catch bugs, or sit down by the water and relax. They like to stay comfortable in t-shorts or sweaters.

Lazy villagers are polite and friendly and so usually get along with everyone.

**Smug**

Smug villagers were introduced in Animal Crossing New Leaf. They are very polite but tend to show excessive pride in themselves and their achievements. They enjoy spending time at home and exploring the island in equal measure. They love to wander around the island speaking to their friends and will usually be wearing a jacket, vest or a sweater.

As Smug villagers are so polite, they get along well with most other personalities, although their ego does annoy cranky and sisterly villagers.

### Female Personality Types

**Normal**

Normal villagers are polite to everyone they come across. They like to split their time between their homes and wondering around the island. They love to cook and keep their homes clean which they will be happy to discuss with you! They love to wear lots of different clothes from dresses to jumpers. They're very easy to get along with  thanks to their kind personality. Although, cranky and snooty villagers may bother normal villagers.

**Peppy**

Peppy villagers are similar to normal villagers as they also enjoy cleaning and are very friendly. However, peppy villagers can be very enthusiastic and some personalities may find this too much to handle. Peppy villagers love to spend most of their time outside talking to other villagers and engaging in lots of activities such as reading books and magazines or fishing.

They love to wear colourful clothes and will always be happy to see you! They get on well with everyone apart from Cranky and Snooty villagers as both types can be hot-headed!

**Snooty**

Snooty villagers can be quite uptight and they also show excessive pride like Smug villagers do. They love to wear highly fashionable outfits like dresses and shirts and then obsess over their image. They love to spend time inside and outside of their home and you will often find them gossiping with other villagers!

Many personality types can be annoyed at Snooty villagers arrogant nature, however, Cranky and Smug villagers get on well with them. Over time, Snooty villagers will warm up to you, but they still may make a mean comment every now and then!

**Sisterly (or Uchi)**

Sisterly villagers were only introduced in Animal Crossing New Leaf like Smug villagers were. Sisterly villagers are the rarest personality type in Animal Crossing. As the name suggests, they are very caring and love to show villagers things they think they might like. They spend an equal amount of time inside and outside their house where they like to sing or stretch.

Sisterly villagers are very popular due to their loving nature. However, they can sometimes appear blunt which can annoy Cranky and Snooty villagers.
