We have some BIG news to share with you all... Our current subscription platform can no longer handle the number of wonderful readers we have and so we’re pleased to announce that we are moving to a new platform!

This means, **all current subscriptions will be cancelled** on **February 1st** at **midnight** and you will need to **re-subscribe** via [shop.thecrossingboard.com](https://shop.thecrossingboard.com). But don't worry, unlike many of Tom Nook's tasks, this one's easy!

We will cancel your current subscription for you, so there’s no need to worry about being charged twice. All you need to do is make sure you have resubscribed on our new site before the 28th of February in order to get our March issue and onwards.

We’re very excited about this upgrade as it will allow us to bring many new features to you all! Some of these include...

- Easy subscription management!
- A loyalty scheme for those who have subscribed for many months...many months.
- Addressing a subscription to a friend with a personal graphic - the perfect gift!
- Reviews from other readers to help you decide which products will best suit you.
- An optional sign-in with records of your past and present orders.
- A brand new newsletter, bringing you the latest updates straight to your inbox.

We’d also like to mention that along with this move, there will be a slight increase in the price of our hard copy subscription. We hope you can understand that this reflects our ever growing service and the highly demanded gifts and content within our fanzines. The change means that we can continue to operate and bring you all your favourite articles, puzzles, recipes and more!

Don’t forget: Once our new platform goes live on the 1st of February, you’ll need to resubscribe to our fanzine at [shop.thecrossingboard.com](https://shop.thecrossingboard.com) before the end of the month in order to receive the March issue and onwards.

If you have any questions regarding our move to a new platform, please do get in contact with us on contact@thecrossingboard.com.

_We will be sending further emails with reminders and information to our current subscribers to ensure everyone is aware and doesn’t miss out during our migration._
