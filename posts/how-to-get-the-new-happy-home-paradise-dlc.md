One of the most exciting announcements to come out of the recent Animal Crossing Direct is the new paid downloadable content: Happy Home Paradise.

If you love to decorate your home in Animal Crossing: New Horizons then this new content is a dream come true! Not only can you design holiday homes for your beloved islanders, but the DLC looks to include loads of new items, mechanics, and characters to the game!

#### **How can I get Happy Home Paradise?**

Happy Home Paradise will be available to preorder from October 29, 2021 and It will be available to play from November 5, 2021.

Users can either play Animal Crossing: New Horizons – Happy Home Paradise by purchasing it in Nintendo eShop or by downloading it at no additional cost after becoming a member of Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack.

#### **What is the difference between buying the DLC on its own and buying the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack?**

Those who buy the Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Happy Home Paradise DLC can play it indefinitely. Those who purchase the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack will be able to play the DLC for the duration of the active membership. This means that if you do not renew your membership for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, you will not be able to play the DLC unless it has been purchased separately.

The save data for the DLC is stored on the console so you can pick up where you left off if you take a break from paying for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack.

#### **Can other users on the same island play Happy Home Paradise if I’m the only Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack member?**

Only the account with an active membership can play the Happy Home Paradise DLC and an internet connection is required when launching the game.

If you have a family membership of Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, then all the accounts that are part of the family group can play for the duration of the membership.

#### **HAPPY HOME PARADISE GIVEAWAY!**
