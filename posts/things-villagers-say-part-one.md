Hello Resident Reps.

It’s Dot here and today I thought it would be fun to have a laugh or two, at the fun things villagers say. By now you’re no stranger to the witticisms and shall I say, unique repartee of some of your islands’ inhabitants? It’s all a part of the magic of playing the game!

Some villagers are known for their charm and humour - especially on island holidays. Peppy types, in particular, are keen on making jokes with fellow islanders when they’re not busy talking about their eminent stardom.

Not to be outdone, snooty villagers bring their own big personalities to the game by adding just a bit of snark cleverly disguised as polite conversation. One thing is certain - our classy and snooty villagers are seldom short of a healthy dose of self-confidence.

Lazy villagers like Sasha can somehow find the time to be all too adorable in between bets and forays into food. Reps will hear these villagers dish (no pun intended) about snacks, candy and bugs to boot.

And then there are those moments, which happen with almost _every_ villager at some point in _every_ Resident Rep’s career - the moments when our villagers are too engaged in their island life to partake of our idea of a great photo taking opportunity. Alas! In such instances, Resident Reps may find themselves being met with the ‘side eye.’

Do you have a favourite villager? Let us know in the comments below.
