We have some BIG news to share with you all... Our current platform can no longer handle the number of amazing subscribers we have and so we are pleased to announce that we are moving to Shopify!

This means, all current subscriptions will be **cancelled** on February 1st and you will need to **re-subscribe** on our new platform... But don't worry, unlike many of Tom Nook's tasks, this one's easy!

We will cancel your current subscription for you; You will need to subscribe to our new shop which will go live on 1st February [here](https://shop.thecrossingboard.com). **Make sure you resubscribe by 31st February to ensure you receive the March and following months magazine editions!**

We are very excited about this upgrade as it will allow us to bring many new features to you all! This will include things such as being able to gift subscriptions (the perfect birthday present!), a new and improved Crossing Board shop website, and your very own Crossing Board account to easily manage your subscriptions. 

We would also like to mention that we are slightly increasing the price of our magazine to reflect the ever growing content and highly demanded gifts included within. This slight increase means we can continue to operate and bring you all the very best articles, puzzles, recipes and more! This has meant we have also been able to increase the quality of our magazine, making it more durable so you can take it with you wherever you go! We hope you understand and would like to thank you for your continued support. 

Don’t forget - **Make sure you resubscribe by 31st February to ensure you receive the March and following months magazine editions!**

If you have any questions regarding our move over to Shopify, please do get in contact with us on contact@thecrossingboard.com. 

*We will be sending further emails with reminders and information to our current subscribers to ensure they are aware and do not miss out during our migration.*
