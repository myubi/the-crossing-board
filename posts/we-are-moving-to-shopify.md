We have some BIG news to share with you all... Our current platform can no longer handle the number of amazing subscribers we have and so we are pleased to announce that we are moving to Shopify!

This means, all current subscriptions will be cancelled and you will need to re-subscribe on our new platform... But don't worry, unlike many of Tom Nook's tasks, this one's easy!

We will cancel your current subscription for you, all you need to do is subscribe to our new shop [here](https://shop.thecrossingboard.com).

We are very excited about this upgrade as it will allow us to bring many new features to you all! This will include things such as being able to gift subscriptions (the perfect birthday present!), yearly subscriptions, a better store interface and your very own Crossing Board account to easily manage your subscriptions. [Sign up](https://shop.thecrossingboard.com) to our email newsletters to receive further information about all the great new additions to our store and extra special promotional offers!

We would also like to mention that we are slightly increasing the price of our magazine to reflect the ever growing content and highly demanded gifts included within. This slight increase means we can continue to operate and bring you all the very best articles, puzzles, recipes and more! We hope you understand and would like to thank you for your continued support.
