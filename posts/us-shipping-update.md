title: US Shipping Update

---

Hey, readers in the United States!

We've heard your feedback and we've been hard at work to minimise postal times for you... We're very excited to finally be able to announce that one of our team members in the US will now be covering your shipments (alongside our team in the UK who will still be covering all other countries).

This means that shipping times should decrease from an average of 2 weeks, to 5 business days. This will further reduce to just 1-3 business days after the holiday period is over!

In order to get to this stage, we will be slightly increasing postage prices for those based in the US. This is due to differing costs in the printing process in the US vs the UK. We have tried to make this change as minimal as possible and based on communications with our readers, it seems like it will be worth it! We hope you can understand.

US standard shipping is increasing from £2.55 to £3.00

US tracked shipping is decreasing from £7.65 to £7.60

**_This will commence with the December issue. Until then, current shipping times and rates will apply._**

Please do contact us if you have any questions regarding this change. You can email us at contact@thecrossingboard.com.
