_Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp_ is a free-to-play mobile app developed by Nintendo. The game was released on November 22, 2017, and requires an internet connection to play. In-app purchases are available.

The game allows you to build a fun campsite for you and your friends to enjoy. As the campsite manager, it is up to you to customise the area by crafting furniture, amenities, and other fun items!

You can visit nearby areas to go fishing, gather fruit, and collect bugs. Animals may also visit these areas, so be sure to stop and say hello. They will ask you to help them with tasks, which will help to grow your friendship and earn rewards.

**General Gameplay**

_Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp_ has in-game objectives to guide players through the management of their campsite. Generally, players will obtain trade items to complete villager requests, for example, Goldie may ask you to catch her a red snapper. You will then be rewarded with craft materials and bells which are required to craft furniture and amenities, buy clothes, upgrade your very own campervan, and much more.

Long-term objectives may include unlocking and increasing friendships with villagers, decorating your campsite and camper van, and completing the Happy Homeroom courses.

_Pocket Camp_ is regularly updated with new items, including furniture and clothing ensuring the game stays exciting and playable.
