In Animal Crossing: New Horizons, the bonds between players and their villagers go beyond mere interactions – they extend to the cute and sometimes hilarious practice of nicknaming. Nicknames are not just a form of address; they represent a term of affection (mostly!) between islanders and the player.

Villagers with high friendship levels may occasionally express their desire to use a nickname for the player. This involves the villager randomly selecting a name, which, if accepted, becomes the exclusive term of address in all future conversations. The beauty lies in the possibility that other villagers might adopt the same nickname over time, fostering a sense of community throughout the island.

However, players have the agency to shape these endearing bonds. When asked for a nickname, players can either accept the proposed one or decline, prompting the villager to either express disappointment or request a new suggestion. An exciting option is the ability to input a custom nickname, and we have seen some wild ones…

In the delightful randomness of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, some villagers might spontaneously start using a nickname without seeking player approval. The selection of nicknames is influenced by the villager's gender and personality, adding an element of uniqueness to each interaction. We were pleased to see that New Horizons breaks free from gender-specific nicknames, providing a more inclusive and diverse experience.

For those craving an extra touch of personalisation, the game also includes personalised nicknames, incorporating the player's initial into the term.
