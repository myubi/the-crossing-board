After lots of requests from our lovely readers, we are very pleased to announce the launch of our gift subscriptions!

Do you know a friend who would LOVE their own copy of The Crossing Board fanzine? Are you looking for the perfect birthday or festive gift? Well, look no further! You can now gift a subscription to the hard copy of our fun-packed fanzine! Available in 3, 6, and 12-month subscriptions.

**How does it work?**

Head over to the [‘Gifts’ ](https://shop.thecrossingboard.com/products/the-crossing-board-gift-subscription)section of our shop. Here you can choose the length of your gift subscription. Add to cart, or press “buy it now” and you will then be able to add the address of the recipient of your gift! Your chosen recipient will then receive their very own copy of our fan-made Animal Crossing magazine filled with activities, inspiration, and much more.

The magazine subscription will commence on the following month. So, if you order in August, your friend will receive the September edition onwards.

You will pay monthly for the subscription plan you choose. This makes it a really easy way to gift a number of fanzines to a friend or loved one!

Lovingly crafted by all of us here at The Crossing Board, our fanzine is a bundle of entertainment shipped to their door every month until the selected period is over. No matter when you choose to commence the subscription, your order will always be for the next month's fanzine. We're sure they'll enjoy their incoming delivery and on behalf of the team, thank you for your support and welcome aboard.

Happy reading!
