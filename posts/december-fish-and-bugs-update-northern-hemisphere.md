One of our favourite things to do on Animal Crossing is to run around our islands looking for all of the animals, swimming or crawling, to donate to our beloved Blathers! We love seeing him display them in all their glory! But which are available in the festive month of December? Well if you’re wondering, you have come to the right place! Here are the fish and bugs that are now available on Animal Crossing in December.
