_Dear readers in the United States_

As some of you may not be aware, our fanzines used to be shipped from the UK. However, we have been working hard over the past few months to set up another shipping location and printing process within the US. We listened to your feedback and wanted to lessen the waiting times for our fanzine each month. For this reason, I am exceptionally disheartened to have to inform you of a significant delay with our printing company, due to a nationwide shortage of paper in the US. We were reassured that printing was on track and were given no warning of the delays, so I hope you can understand that this unprecedented situation is frustratingly out of our control. To remedy it as best we can, we have negotiated the fastest alternative, which means your December fanzines will be sent out to you from the US on the 27th of December. We are so deeply sorry for the disappointment this may bring. I understand that this is far from ideal, but I would be sincerely grateful if you could bear with us and await your copy. In doing this, you would be supporting our community project, and enabling us to continue through this difficult period. Please be assured, we are taking measures to prevent paper shortages from impacting our fanzine deliveries in the future.

In the meantime, you will all have received a free digital copy of the December fanzine so you donâ€™t miss out on its content. This has been sent to your email. For those customers who purchased our fanzines as a gift, we have also emailed you 2 printable notecards which could be given in the meantime. 

My sincerest apologies,

 _Jemima (on behalf of The Crossing Board team)_
