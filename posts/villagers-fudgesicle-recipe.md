It’s the height of summer and your Animal Crossing: New Horizons villagers are wandering around the island with some kind of icy, chocolate-y dessert. Do you feel left out and wish you could try one for yourself? Well, now you can! Until Nintendo lets us join in with our villager’s adorable summer picnics, the best option is to make your own.
 
Whether you know them as fudge pops, ice lollies, fudgesicles, or popsicles - we’re sure you’ll like this rich yet refreshing treat. All you need for this recipe is a mold and a handful of ingredients; it couldn't be simpler! You can also make this recipe vegan by swapping the Nutella for vegan butter and adding an extra tablespoon of cocoa powder.

## Ingredients:

- 2 ½ cups milk (we used oat, but cow’s milk will work just as well).
- ½ cup sugar 
- 2 tbsp cornstarch, sifted
- 1 tbsp cocoa powder, sifted 
- 1 tbsp nutella 
- 1 tsp vanilla extract 


## Method:

1. Add the milk, sugar, cornstarch, and cocoa powder to a saucepan on medium heat and whisk to combine. Make sure your powders are well sifted otherwise your ice lollies will be lumpy and not very appetising (trust us). 

2. Cook mixture, stirring occasionally, until it’s slightly thickened. This should take around 15 minutes depending on the original thickness of your milk. 

3. Remove from heat and add the nutella and vanilla. Stir until everything has melted and the mixture is smooth. Let sit for a few minutes until cool enough to handle. 

4. Gently pour mixture into your molds, leaving a couple of centimetres at the top as they will expand slightly when they freeze. Pop in the freezer for at least five hours to completely set.
 
5. To enjoy your new icy treat, run mold under a warm tap to loosen and free your popsicle. Serve with some fresh, sunny air and some quality time playing Animal Crossing! Maybe your villagers will be enjoying one too.
