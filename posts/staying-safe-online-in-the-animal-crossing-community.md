title: Staying Safe Online in the Animal Crossing Community

---
Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a game like no other before it in the franchise. While New Leaf had online features and a healthy social media following, New Horizons has certainly eclipsed it. For the past year and a half, players have connected with friends old and new and shown off their creative talents in the form of island builds and custom designs on social media platforms from Instagram to Pinterest. Yes, at its core, New Horizons is a wholesome and friendly game for ages, but with a community in the millions and content almost everywhere you turn, it comes with risks. Let’s explore how you can safely enjoy Animal Crossing and its online world.

Watch out for scams. This includes the simple “villager in boxes” hoax in which you exchange bells or items for a villager who is supposedly moving out but once you go into their house you discover they aren’t. A more extreme scam is being asked to use real-life money to get a villager or items you want. If something looks too good to be true, it probably is.

Social media, where many players have dedicated accounts to the game, can be a minefield at the best of times. Consider setting profiles to private or allowing only your friends and trusted followers to view your content.

Reach out to your friends and family to ensure they respect your privacy, when it comes to uploading posts, tagging and location sharing and also use them as a support network if things begin to get overwhelming. A lot of players have large followings on their platforms so it’s important to take care of yourself and maintain a healthy balance between the virtual and real world.

Always think about what you post before hitting that send button. Don’t forget, even with the most private of settings and trustworthy followers, things can still potentially be shared anywhere online. There are no guarantees that content won’t get into the wrong hands. It goes without saying that you should avoid sharing personal information such as contact and bank details.

A further tip is to regularly review your friend and follower lists. If someone is giving particularly negative vibes or is making you feel bad you can either unfriend/follow them or consider using the block feature if you don’t want someone viewing your account full stop. Instagram now has a handy feature that allows you to also block any future accounts a user may create.

Here at The Crossing Board, we want to ensure that all of our subscribers, followers and our team feels like they are in a safe space, which is why our direct messages are always open to anyone who is struggling, need support or just someone to listen to them.
