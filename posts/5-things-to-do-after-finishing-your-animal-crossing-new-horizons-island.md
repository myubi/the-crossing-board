If you have finished decorating and terraforming your island and are looking for fun activities to do in the Animal Crossing: New Horizons game, then we have got you covered!

We know the process of planting flowers, thinking up colour schemes and styles, and moving bridges can be long and tedious. So, whether you have finished decorating your island paradise or just need to take a break from your renovations, we have a list of our top 5 things to do on your island to get you through to the next update!

1. **Finish the Museum**

This is a huge task that can take a lot of committed hours of gameplay. There are paintings, statues, fish, bugs, fossils, and sea creatures to find and catch to complete the long list of items to display in the museum.

You will need to find 1 of each type of item, fish, or bug and present these to the beloved Blathers. He will then show these off in your island's museum for all of your visitors and islanders to enjoy!

There are 80 fish to catch, 40 sea creatures, 80 bugs, 73 fossils, and 43 pieces of art to find and donate - that is 316 in total!

2. **Get Into Custom Design**

A huge part of Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the design element. You can create so many different items from dresses to flags to hats!

Our favourite thing about custom designs is that they are a really great way to make your island unique to you. Using custom design paths is a particularly great way to change up the appearance of your island. You can either create your own or download other creators' designs in the custom designs portal.

We also love the addition of photo standees which have allowed for some amazing island additions such as buses, swings, and fences. We have featured our favourite custom designs in our [May fanzine edition.](https://shop.thecrossingboard.com/collections/digital-fanzines/products/may-2021-digital-fanzine)

You can also find our guide to creating your own custom designs in the [January edition of our fanzine.](https://shop.thecrossingboard.com/collections/digital-fanzines/products/january-2021)

3. **Max All of Your Villagers’ Friendships**

Nothing is quite as rewarding as your villagers gifting you their photo. It can take a while to win some villagers over, so this task is a great one to do on the side of your other island activities.

We love to decorate our own island home with these photos, or some like to use them outside the respective villagers’ house to show visitors who lives there.

We have also created a guide to levelling up your villager friendships which can be found in our [February edition.](https://shop.thecrossingboard.com/collections/digital-fanzines/products/february-2021-digital-fanzine)

4. **Visit Dream Islands**

Visiting dream islands is a great way to experience all of the other wonderful islands in the Animal Crossing: New Horizons community. You can visit dream islands anytime you want, and don’t even need a specific island’s dream address! Just hop into your bed and you will be whisked away with the help of Luna.

Although...this activity does usually mean we are then dreaming of redecorating…

5. **Build All Four Players Islands**

Why decorate just one villager's house when you could create and decorate all four? Many players forget that you can create up to four players on your island and each one can have their own home. This means that you could decorate one as a hotel, one as a concert hall, one as a shop...the options are endless!

Simply create another profile on your Nintendo Switch and then open the Animal Crossing: New Horizons game.

We hope these ideas keep you busy on your island and have provided some inspiration for some activities to enjoy while we wait for the next Animal Crossing: New Horizons update. Don’t forget to follow us over on our socials (you can find the links at the bottom of this page) for lots more exciting activity ideas!
